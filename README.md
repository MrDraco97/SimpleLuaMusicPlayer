Hi there, this is a little simple music player that my friend and I made with also a little assistance from AI. We made this as a joke, but it ended up being pretty good. If you'd like to improve anything, go ahead!

To set it up, you will need the Love2D Engine. You can obtain that here:
https://love2d.org/
It is supported on all operating systems, it also has an Appimage for Linux so no need to worry if your distro is supported or not.
You can then clone this repository, preferably on your desktop. After that, look for where your Love2D files are placed and copy the shortcut to your desktop. After that, you can simply drag the directory on top of the Love2D shortcut. Woila, you have a music player.
Hold on though, how do I add my own music?
Well, you can add in any .mp3 file into the cloned respository and just rename it to "music1.mp3" or "music2.mp3," name them in the order you want them to play.
There are also 2 seperate playlists, and each playlist can contain a maximum of 6 .mp3 files. However, be sure to name the .mp3 files for playlist #2 from 7-12.
The music player is really buggy right now and needs a lot of improvements, and hopefully someone else can commit some changes to make it better. For now though, it requires quite a bit of tinkering to use.
I also plan to compile an exe/deb/appimage file in the future.

Anyways, enjoy using this stupid little music player :D.
